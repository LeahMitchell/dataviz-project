# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the Marvel character dataset. It contains information about the superhero such as gender, race, skin color, eye color, and alignment. There are numeric based power measurements (such as strength, inteligence, or speed) that cumulate into a total score. There is also many specific super powers (stealth, weapons master, or super strength) that are in a binary format for each character.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What numeric or categorical strength is more prevelant across the characters? 
 * Who are the strongest characters (by total numeric strength/powers or by total categorical powers or by both) overall and what is their allignment? 
 * Following up on strongest, what are some of the patterns or characteristics of the strongest or weakest characters?
 * What are some of the general trends across the genders, such as alignments, powers, race and general count of characters?
 * Do certain numerical power scores correlate to specific categorical powers?
 * What are the various patterns in gender, numeric and categorical powers for teams (i.e. original avengers), partners (i.e. Falcon and Winter Solider), and enemies (i.e. Ironman and Thanos)

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

I am worried about being able to do all the various interactive pieces I want. I have some simplier visualizations in mind, but something like being able to add multiple heros onto one spider graph is a task that is daunting to me. I'm overall worried about not being able to make the visualizations "pretty" since my background is in Python and not java and I don't have super strong art skills.
